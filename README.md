# PQ-Problem
The P&Q problem was presented by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his book "The Haystack Syndrome: Sifting Information Out of the Data Ocean, Croton-on-Hudson, NY: North River Press Inc., 1990. The idea is to find the best product mix with a maximum net profit by varying the numbers of product P and Q under given circumstances.

In co-operation with Wolfram Research, I have launched an interactive simulation of the PQ-Problem to find the maximum net profit by a user.

A mathematical solution can be easily found by Integer Linear Programming. The Mathematica notebook "The P&Q-Problem Solution with Mathematica" in standard Mathematica format and CDF format shows a pragmatic way how to solve this kind of problem.

A copy of the Mathematica notebook in PDF format is available for interested readers that do not have access to Mathematica software.

## Update on February 2, 2021

I have added a Jupyter-Notebook for the free **Wolfram Engine**, https://www.wolfram.com/engine/. Information about the **Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks** is available here on Github: https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter
