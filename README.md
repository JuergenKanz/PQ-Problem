# PQ-Problem
The P&Q problem was presented by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his book "The Haystack Syndrome: Sifting Information Out of the Data Ocean, Croton-on-Hudson, NY: North River Press Inc., 1990. The idea is to find the best product mix with a maximum net profit by varying the numbers of product P and Q under given circumstances.

In co-operation with Wolfram Research, I have launched an interactive simulation of the PQ-Problem to find the maximum net profit by a user.

A mathematical solution can be easily found by Integer Linear Programming. The Mathematica notebook "The P&Q-Problem Solution with Mathematica" in this repository shows a pragmatic way how to solve this kind of problem.

A copy of the Mathematica notebook in PDF format is available as well for interested readers that do not have access to Mathematica software.
