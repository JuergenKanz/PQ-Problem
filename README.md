# PQ-Problem
The P&Q problem was presented by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his book "The Haystack Syndrome: Sifting Information Out of the Data Ocean, Croton-on-Hudson, NY: North River Press Inc., 1990. The idea is to find the best product mix with a maximum net profit by varying the numbers of product P and Q under given circumstances.

I have launched an interactive simulation to find the maximum profit net by the user.
